### changelog | xlwings_utils

[The full documentation can be found here.](https://www.salabim.org/xlwings_utils)

#### version 25.0.8  2025-08-06

  - `block.transpose()` is now called `block.transposed()`
  - optimised setting None values in a block (now deleted from the dict)
  - equality test added (based on value)
  - updated tests

#### version 25.0.7  2025-08-05

  - `block` does not accept a value anymore; use the new`block.from_value()` or use the new -arguably more useful- `block.from_range()`.
  - `block.value` can't be used to set a value anymore (see above)
  - `block.encode_files` is now called `block.encode_file` and can encode only one file at a time
  - the class methods `from_xxx` do not support number_of_rows and number_of_columns parameters anymore; instead use the new `reshape` method 
  - the repo now contains the file xlwings_utils.bas, which can be used as a module to encode and decode encoded files on a sheet.

#### version 25.0.6  2025-08-01

- #### File transfers via VBA are now done with:

  - `block.encode_files(*files)`
  * `block.decode_files()`
  * `trigger_macro()`

- `read_dropbox()` now retries automatically (by default 100 times)


#### version 25.0.5  2025-07-21

- added:
  * `trigger_VBA()`
  * `init_transfer_files()`
  * `transfer_file()`

#### version 25.0.4  2025-07-14

- ssl is no longer in the requirements section of pyproject.toml as that caused problems with pip install on regular installations. As a consequence, ssl has to be added to the requirement.txt xlwings lite panel.
- dropbox_init can now propagate keyword parameters to dropbox.dropbox, to facilitate experimenting.

#### version 25.0.3  2025-06-08
- updated tests
- now lookup, hlookup and vlookup have an optional default parameter. If used, default will be returned if
  the value is not found. Otherwise, a ValueError exception will be raised.
- now lookup_row and lookup_column have an optional default parameter. If used, default will be returned if
  the row or columnn cannot be found. Otherwise, a ValueError will be raised.
- internal change: optional parameters are now handled with missing rather than None.
- a script to set up dropbox is now available under https://www.salabim.org/dropbox%20setup.py. Also, instructions on how to run that file are added to the readme file.

#### version 25.0.2  2025-06-07
- sometimes reading from Dropbox with xwu.read_dropbox does not return the right contents.
  In that case, now an OSError exception is raised. This makes it possible to retry then.
  The message will show both the actual and expected file size.

#### version 25.0.1  2025-05-26
- now uses *calver* versioning
- complete overhaul of capture_stdout, which is now to be initiated with `capture = xwu.Capture()`
- block has now methods to lookup values in a block, which is very convenient for project / scenario sheets:
  - `lookup()` / `vlookup()`
  - `hlookup()`
  - `lookup_row()`
  - `lookup_column()`
- block now has some additional class methods:
  - `from_xlrd_sheet()`
  - `from_openpyxl_sheet()`
  - `from_dataframe()`
  -  from_file()

- block now has a method to write to an openpyxl sheet: `to_openpyxl_sheet`

- an application can now check `xwu.xlwings` to see whether it runs in an xlwings environment.

#### version 0.0.7  2025-05-07

- maximum_row is renamed to highest_used_row_number
- maximum_column is renamed to highest_used_column_number
- block can now also be initialised with a block, which can be helpful to redimension a block
- more tests
- documentation improvements

- under Pythonista, Dropbox credentials will now be retrieved from .environ.toml file
- list_dropbox and list_local can now optionally show folders
